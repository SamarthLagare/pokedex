# Pokédex - An Interactive Web Experience डेक्स 🎮⚡
A fully interactive, single-page web application that brings the world of Pokémon to life with animations, sound effects, and a retro pixel aesthetic inspired by the classic games. This isn’t a static data display—it’s an experience. Search for any Pokémon and watch the Pokédex open up with detailed information, animations, and sound interactions.

✨ Live Demo ➡ (https://your-samarthlagare.github.io/pokedex/) 

✅ Features  
This project is built using **vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, leveraging [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) for data and [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/) for audio effects. You get:  
🔍 Universal Search – Search for any Pokémon by name or National Pokédex ID.  
🎨 Dynamic Theming – The UI adapts to match the Pokémon’s primary type with vibrant colors.  
✨ Shiny Sprite Toggle – Instantly switch between regular and shiny sprites with a satisfying toggle.  
🔗 Interactive Evolution Chain – View a Pokémon’s full evolution sequence, including Mega Evolutions. Click any stage to trigger evolution animations or de-evolution effects.  
📊 Comprehensive Data Display – Official artwork with floating animation, name, ID, height, weight, abilities, in-game description, and base stats with animated bars. Weaknesses and strengths based on type relations.  
🎶 Sound Effects & UI Feedback – Hear Pokémon cries, interact with UI sounds powered by Tone.js, and enjoy logo hover-triggered Pokéball bursts.  
🔥 Engaging Animations – Sleek Pokédex opening and closing, animations for evolution, Mega evolution, and de-evolution, plus smooth hover effects and transitions.  
📱 Fully Responsive – Works across desktop and mobile devices without layout issues.

🛠 Technologies Used  
HTML5 for structure, CSS3 for styling and animations, JavaScript (ES6+) for logic and API integration, PokéAPI (v2) for data source, Tone.js for Web Audio effects, Google Fonts (‘Press Start 2P’ & ‘VT323’) for pixel aesthetics, and Font Awesome for icons.

🚀 Getting Started  
No build tools needed—just a browser!  
1. Clone the repository:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pokedex-project.git
```  
2. Navigate to the project folder:  
```bash
cd pokedex-project
```  
3. Open the file:  
Double-click `pokedex.html` or open it in Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc. You’re ready to start exploring Pokémon!

📖 How to Use  
Enter a Pokémon's name (e.g., “pikachu”) or ID (e.g., “25”) into the search bar, press Enter or click the search icon, and watch the Pokédex animate open with details, artwork, stats, and more. Interact with the UI by clicking the volume button to hear cries, toggling shiny sprites, clicking on evolutions to watch animations, or using the ‘X’ button to close the Pokédex and return to the search screen.
