# Pokédex - An Interactive Web Experience 🎮⚡

A fully interactive, single-page web application that brings the world of Pokémon to life with animations, sound effects, and a retro pixel aesthetic inspired by the classic games. This isn’t a static data display—it’s an experience. Search for any Pokémon and watch the Pokédex open up with detailed information, animations, and sound interactions.

- 🎶 **Sound Effects & UI Feedback** – Hear Pokémon cries, interact with UI sounds powered by Tone.js, and enjoy logo hover-triggered Pokéball bursts.
